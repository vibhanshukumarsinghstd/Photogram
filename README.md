In this project, I designed a visually appealing single-page web application using HTML and CSS. It features a sleek sidebar menu for easy navigation and a stunning background that enhances the user experience.

Key Features:
Responsive Design: The layout adapts beautifully to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile.
Intuitive Sidebar Navigation: A collapsible menu that provides easy access to sections like Gallery, Exhibits, Events and more.
Social Media Integration: Connect with us through various platforms, enhancing user engagement.

This project helped me deepen my understanding of web design principles and CSS styling techniques. I used Google Fonts for typography and Font Awesome for icons to elevate the visual appeal.
